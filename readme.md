**Proof of Work (PoW)**

Implement a PoW verifier for Bitcoin to understand how the mining process operates within the network. Proof of Work is crucial as it ensures that creating new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain requires significant computational effort. This effort is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the network. Therefore, you need to build a function that simulates this process by verifying whether a block hash meets the established difficulty requirements and experimenting with different levels of difficulty to observe how it affects mining time.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a function that verifies if a block hash is valid according to the level of difficulty.
- Simulate the calculation of multiple hashes until one meets the target.
- Display the time it takes to find a valid hash at different difficulty levels.
